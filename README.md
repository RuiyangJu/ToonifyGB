### Original Video 
* Our original videos (real head) are from [INSTA](https://github.com/Zielon/INSTA). You can access the links to download them.

### Stylized Video
* You can find our generated stylized videos [here](https://1drv.ms/f/c/56c255dd1bb9ae9e/EpfvYbd5LQtDjp0aZAvLD_gBz85KRB5LIPiVF9m0EGPIzA).

### Data Process
* We follow INSTA to process data.
If you wanna process your own dataset, please follow the instructions in their [repository](https://github.com/Zielon/INSTA).
You can use [Metrical Photometric Tracker](https://github.com/Zielon/metrical-tracker) to track and run `generate.sh` provided by INSTA to mask the head.
* Copy files from outputs of the tracker and INSTA's script and organize them in the following form:
  
```
<DATA_ID>
    ├── checkpoint # generated by the tracker 
    ├── images # generated by the script of INSTA
    ├── canonical.obj # generated by the tracker
```

### Stylized Avatar
* For stylized avatar synthesis, you can find some of our proprocessed datasets [here](https://1drv.ms/f/c/56c255dd1bb9ae9e/EtL-0jI9YhpOgsJ78yU1lZUB93gNVRQ5mx0edGymGLlIAg).

## Train
### Stylized Video Generation

### Stylized Avatar Synthesis
* You can find some of our pre-trained models [here](https://1drv.ms/f/c/56c255dd1bb9ae9e/Eiji5bsXmmRIocx7saA8RYcBJANLmcWml6j7oTEdD41KPQ).

## FaceViewer
* We use FaceViewer released by [GaussianBlendshapes](https://github.com/zjumsj/GaussianBlendshapes). For Windows users, a pre-built binary is available for download [here](https://1drv.ms/u/c/56c255dd1bb9ae9e/ERR1ZtnEdqNFi7POwlFDjFUBBm0ze-9tO0a_xmYoiPTlyA?e=TQBlaM).
* If FaceViewer cannot start because VCOMP120.DLL is missing, you can download [vcredist](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784) to solve this problem.
